      Respect Fellow Passengers:
      Creating a respectful and considerate environment on the bus enhances everyone's safety. Be mindful of noise levels, avoid blocking aisles with belongings, and follow any guidelines provided by the bus company to ensure a harmonious journey.
      
      Stay Hydrated and Well-Rested:
